# Turkish Bomb Party ðŸ’£ðŸ’£

[[Turkish README.md|TÃ¼rkÃ§e]]

## Overview
This project is a clone of the popular online word game "Bomb Party". The game challenges players to quickly think of words that match a given syllable before a timer runs out. This repository contains the code for replicating the gameplay experience of Bomb Party, including a wide range of syllables to help your vocabulary, with a turn timer to up the ante.

## Features
- **Turn Timer**: A countdown timer starts when a new syllable is displayed, ends game when it reaches zero.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points for correctly guessed words, and you can compare scores locally.
- **Interactive User Interface**: The game provides feedback to players on their actions, including helpful tips to improve performance and improve vocabulary.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/bomb-party-clone.git`
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
3. Run `turkish word fixer.py` to format the word list to your liking.
4. Run `syllable finder.py`, making sure to clearly state file locations, to generate the JSON for the game.
5. Customize the game settings at the top of the `script.js` file, such as timer duration and syllable list, as needed.
6. Open `index.html` in a web browser to play the game.

## Usage
- Upon starting the game, a syllable will be displayed, and the turn timer will begin counting down.
- Enter a word that matches the displayed syllable into the text field and press enter (or the submit button).
- If the word is correct, you will earn a point, and a new syllable will be displayed.
- If the word is incorrect or has already been guessed, you will receive a warning message, and you can try again!
- The game continues until the timer runs out, at which point the final scores are displayed.
